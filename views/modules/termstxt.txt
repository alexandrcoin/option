Framework:
A user speculates on the price of an option and the expiry time of the offer.
If a trade is applied it can not be deleted, removed, reversed, or refunded.
A 'trade' is money placed on the direction of the price of a stock option in the next few minutes.
If the price changes in the users favor, you are in the money, the user wins a scaled reward.
It is a loss if the price moves in the opposite direction and the trade expires.
If the final stock price is exactly the same, the user is refunded.
